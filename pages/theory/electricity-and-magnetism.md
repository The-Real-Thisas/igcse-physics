# Electricity and Magnetism

Simple phenomena of magnetism
-----------------------------

### MAGNETS:

-   Magnets have a magnetic field around them

-   They 2 opposite poles (North and South) which exert forces on other magnets. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is caused by the interaction of magnetic fields.

    -   Therefore, if magnets are facing each other with opposite poles, they will come together given a small space between them
-   They attract magnetic materials by inducing (permanent or temporary) magnetism in them.

-   Will exert little or no force on a non-magnetic material

-   The direction of an electric field at a point is the direction of the force on a positive charge at that point

-   Induced Magnetism:

    -   Magnets attract materials by inducing magnetism in them; the material becomes a magnet as well.

    -   The side of the material facing the magnet will become the opposite pole as the magnet.

-   Methods of inducing magnetism:

-   A piece of steel becomes permanently magnetized when placed near a magnet, but its magnetism is usually weak.

-   It can be magnetized more strongly by stroking it with one end of a magnet

-   *Most effective method: place it in a solenoid and pass a large, direct current (d.c.) through the coil.*

-   Methods of demagnetisation:

    -   If a magnet is hammered, its atomic magnets are thrown out of line and it becomes demagnetized.

    -   Heating a magnet to a high temperature also demagnetize it.

    -   Stroking with another magnet to destroy the alignment of poles

    -   Place magnet with poles opposite to that which is induced by a d.c. current and insert into coil with d.c. current

    -   Most efficient method: place magnet inside a solenoid connected to an alternating current (a.c.) supply.

-   Soft Iron vs. Steel

| Soft iron | Steel |
| --- | --- |
| Gets magnetized faster but loses its magnetism as soon as inducing magnet is removed. | Slow to be magnetized but retains acquired magnetism for a long time. |
| High susceptibility but low retentivity | Low susceptibility but high retentivity. |
| Use: core in the transformer | Use: making magnets. |

Permanent Magnet vs. Electromagnet

| Permanent Magnet | Electromagnet |
| --- | --- |
| Design: hard magnetic material | Design: Uses a solenoid to create magnetic field |
| Use: for applications where magnetism is needed over long periods -- fridge doors | Use: For applications where magnetic field needs to be turned on & off - scrap metal moving |

Electric Charge
---------------

-   There are 2 types of charges: positive and negative.

-   Unlike charges attract and like charges repel.

-   The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C).

-   The presence of an electrostatic charge can be detected using a leaf electroscope.

    -   If a charged object is placed near the cap, charges are induced.

    -   The metal cap gets one type of charge (positive or negative) and the metal stem and gold leaf get the other type of charge so they repel each other.

-   Electric field: region in which electric charge experiences a force.

-   The direction of an electric field at a point is the direction of the force on a positive charge at that point

-   Conductors: materials that let electrons pass through them. Metals are the best electrical conductors as they have free electrons. E.g. copper

-   Insulators: materials that hardly conduct at all. Their electrons are tightly held to atoms and hardly move, but they can be transferred by rubbing. E.g. Rubber

-   Simple Field Patterns:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel plates | Point charge | +ve and -ve | +ve and +ve |

-   Induced charges:

    -   Charging a body involves the addition or removal of electrons.

    -   A charge that "appears" on an uncharged object because of a charged object nearby

    -   For example if a positively charged rod is brought near a small piece of aluminum foil, electrons in foil are pulled towards rod, which leaves the bottom of the foil with a net positive charge.

    -   The attraction is stronger than repulsion because the attracting charges are closer than the repelling ones.


 Current
-------

-   Current: a flow of charge, the SI unit is the Ampere (A).

-   An ammeter measures the current in a circuit and is connected in series

-   Current is a rate of flow of charge.

-   In metals, current is caused by a flow of electrons

-   Current follows path of least resistance

-   Conventional current flows in the direction opposite to that which electrons flow in.

-   Red = Conventional Current

-   Green = flow of electrons

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image065.png)

Electromotive Force (EMF)
-------------------------

-   The energy supplied by the source in driving a unit charge around a circuit.

-   The maximum voltage a cell can produce is called the electromotive force (EMF), measured in volts.

-   When a current is being supplied, the voltage is lower because of the energy wastage inside the cell.

-   A cell produces its maximum PD when not in a circuit and not supplying current.

Potential Difference (P.D)
--------------------------

-   Potential difference, or PD for short, is also known as voltage.

-   Voltage is the amount of energy the cell gives the electrons it pushes out. Voltage is measured in volts (V) and is measured by a voltmeter (connected in parallel). If a cell has 1 Volt, it delivers 1 Joule of energy to each coulomb of charge (J/C).

Resistance
----------

Factors affecting resistance:

-   Length

    -   The electrons have to travel a longer length and thus encounter more resistance.

-   Cross-sectional area

    -   More electrons can flow per unit time, increasing the current and therefore decreasing the resistance.

-   Material

    -   Better conductor = less resistance
-   Current Voltage Character of an Ohmic Resistor and a Filament Lamp:

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image039.png)

-   Ohm's law states that voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it. This is only true if the temperature of the resistor or lamp remains constant

Electrical Energy
-----------------

-   Electrical energy is transferred from the battery or power source to the circuit components then into the surroundings

-   1 Watt is 1J/s

Series and Parallel Circuits
----------------------------

-   The current at any point in a series circuit is the same

-   The current splits at each branch in a parallel circuit so the total current is always greater than the current in one branch

-   Combining resistors

    -   In Series:

    -   In Parallel:

    -   The combined resistance of 2 resistors in parallel is less than that of either resistor by itself and the current in the two resistors in greater in the source than in the individual resistors and is equal to the sum of the currents in all the resistors connected in parallel.

-   Advantages of putting lamps in parallel are:

    -   If one lamp breaks, the other still works

    -   Each lamp gets maximum PD

-   In series: PD across the supply = PD across all the components combined

-   In parallel: Current across the source = sum of currents in the separate branches

Action and Use of Circuit Components
------------------------------------

-   A potential divider divides the voltage into smaller parts.

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image040.png)

-   To find the voltage (at V~OUT~) we use the following formula:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_{OUT}=V_{IN}\times\left(\frac{R_2}{R_{Total}}&space;\right))

-   A variable potential divider (potentiometer) is the same as the one above but using a variable resistor; it acts like a potential divider, but you can change output voltage.

-   Input Transducers:

    -   Thermistor: input sensor and a transducer. It is a temperature-dependent resistor. At higher temperature there is less resistance.

        ![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image102.png)
    -   Light dependent resistor (LDR): input sensor and a transducer. When light intensity increases, resistance decreases.

        ![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image103.png)
-   Relays:

    -   A switch operated by an electromagnet

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image041.png)

-   Normally closed relay: when coil *not energized*, switch is closed, completing circuit

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image042.png)

-   Normally open relay: when coil *energized*, switch is closed, completing circuit

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image043.png)

-   Diodes:

    -   A device that has an extremely high resistance in one direction and a low resistance in the other, therefore it effectively only allows current to flow in one direction

    -   Forward bias is when the diode is pointing in the direction of the conventional current and reverse bias is the opposite

    -   It can be used in a rectifier; turns AC current into DC current.

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image044.png)

Digital Electronics
-------------------

-   Analogue uses a whole range of continuous variations to transmit a signal that include variations of high and low states.

-   Digital signals use only 2 states, on and off.

-   Logic gates are processors that are circuits containing transistors and other components. Their function is shown by the truth table below (3 columns from the right)

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image045.png)

Dangers of Electricity
----------------------

-   Hazards:

    -   Damaged insulation: contact with the wire (live wire especially) due to gap in the insulation causes electric shock which can cause serious injury or shock.

    -   Overheating of cables: when long extension leads are coiled up, they may overheat. The current warms the wire, but the heat has less area to escape from a tight bundle. This might cause a fire.

    -   Damp conditions: water can conduct a current, so if electrical equipment is wet someone might get electrocuted

-   Fuse:

    -   A fuse protects a circuit.

    -   Thin piece of wire which overheats and melts if current is too high.

    -   It is placed on the live wire before the switch.

    -   This prevents overheating and catching fire.

    -   A fuse will have a specific current value (e.g. 13 Amps.) so when choosing a suitable fuse, you must use the one above minimum value but less than maximum value

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image046.png)

-   Circuit Breaker:

    -   An automatic switch which if current rises over a specified value, the electromagnet pulls the contacts apart, breaking the circuit.

    -   The reset button is to rest everything.

    -   It works like a fuse but is better because it can be reset.

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image047.png)

-   Benefits of Earthing a Metal Case:

    -   Many electrical appliances, have metal cases, the earth wire creates a safe route for current to flow through if the live wire touches the casing

    -   Earth terminal connected to metal casing, so in such a case, the current goes through earth wire instead of causing an electric shock.

    -   A strong current surges through earth wire because it has very low resistance

    -   This breaks the fuse and disconnects the appliance

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image048.png)

Electromagnetic Effects
-----------------------

-   Electromagnetic Induction: If a wire is passed across a magnetic field/changing magnetic field, a small EMF is induced and can be detected by a galvanometer.

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image049.png)

-   The direction of an induced EMF opposes the change causing it.

-   The induced EMF can be increased by:

    -   moving the wire faster

    -   using a stronger magnet

    -   Increasing length of wire in magnetic field, e.g. looping the wire through the field several times.

-   The current and EMF direction can be reversed by:

    -   moving the wire in the opposite direction

    -   turning the magnet round so that the field direction is reversed

-   Fleming's right-hand rule gives the current direction:

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image050.png)

Bar magnet pushed into coil

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image051.png)

-   The induced EMF (and current) can be increased by:

    -   moving the magnet faster

    -   using a stronger magnet

    -   increasing the number of turns in the coil

-   If the magnet is pulled away, the direction of the induced EMF (and current) is reversed

-   Using South pole instead of North pole reverses direction of induced EMF (and current)

-   If the magnet is held still, there is no EMF

-   An induced current always flows in a direction such that it opposes the change which produced it.

-   When a magnet is moved towards a coil the pole of the coil and magnet next to each other are the same.

-   When the magnet is moved away the poles are opposite (opposite poles attract).

-   The pole-type (north or south) is controlled by the direction in which the current is induced.

-   The direction of the current is given by the right-hand grip rule:

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image052.png)

-   The fingers point in the conventional current direction and the thumb gives the North Pole.

Applications
------------

-   In a direct current (d.c) the electrons flow in a singular direction.

-   In an alternating current (a.c) the direction of flow is reversed in regular time periods.

-   A.C Generator:

    -   The coil is made of insulated copper wire and is rotated by turning the shaft; the slip rings are fixed to the coil and rotate with it.

    -   The brushes are 2 contacts which rub against the slip rings and keep the coil connected to the outside part of the circuit, usually made of carbon.

    -   When the coil is rotated, it cuts magnetic field lines, so an EMF is generated, which makes a current flow.

    -   Each side of the coil travels upwards then downwards then upwards etc. so the current flows backwards then forwards then backwards etc. so it is an alternating current.

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image053.png)

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image054.png)

-   The current is maximum when the coil is horizontal since field lines are being cut at the fastest rate and 0 when the coil is vertical, since it is cutting NO field lines.

-   The EMF can be increased by:

    -   increasing the number of turns on the coil

    -   increasing the area of the coil

    -   using a stronger magnet

    -   rotating the coil faster

Transformers
------------

-   AC currents can be increased or decreased by using a transformer.

-   Consists of a primary coil, a secondary coil and an iron core.

-   The iron core gets magnetized by the incoming current and this magnetism then creates a current in the leaving wire.

-   The power is the same on both sides (assume= 100% efficiency).

-   You can figure out number of coils and the voltage with:

(Under 100% efficiency)

-   When magnetic field is changed across the primary coil by connecting it with A.C. an e.m.f. induces across the secondary coil.

-   The iron core channels the alternating field through the secondary coil, inducing an alternating e.m.f. across it.

-   A step-up transformer increases the voltage and a step-down transformer decreases it.

-   Transformers used to make high voltage AC currents.

-   Since power lost in a resistor , having a lower current will decrease the power loss.

-   Since transmission cables are many kilometres long they have a lot of resistance, so a transformer is used to increase the voltage and decrease the current to decease power lost.

-   The advantages of high-voltage transmission:

    -   Less power lost

    -   Thinner, light, and cheaper cables can be used since current is reduced

Electromagnetic Effect of a Current
-----------------------------------

-   Magnetic field around a current carrying wire

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image056.png)

-   Magnetic field around a current carrying solenoid

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image057.png)

-   Increasing the strength of the field

-   Increasing the current increases the strength of the field

-   Increasing the number of turns of a coil increases the strength increases the strength of the field.

-   Reversing the current direction reverses the magnetic field direction (right-hand rule).

-   The direction of a magnetic field line at a point is the direction of the force on the N pole of a magnet at that point

-   Magnetic effect of current is used in a relay and a circuit breaker.

Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor
-------------------------------------

-   If a current carrying conductor is in a magnetic field, it warps the field lines.

-   The field lines from the magnet want to straighten out naturally.

-   This causes a catapult like action on the wire creating a force

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image058.png)

-   If you reverse current, you will reverse direction of force

-   If you reverse direction of field, you will reverse direction of force.

-   The direction of the force, current or magnetic field is given by Fleming's left-hand rule:

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image059.png)

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image060.png)

D.C. Motor
----------

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image061.png)

-   When a current-carrying coil is in a magnetic field, it experiences a turning effect.

-   A DC motor runs on a direct current.

-   The coil is made of insulated copper wire and is free to rotate between the poles of the magnet.

-   The commutator (split-ring) is fixed to the coil and rotates with it.

-   When the coil overshoots the vertical, the commutator changes direction of the current through it, so the forces change direction and keep the coil turning.

-   The brushes are two contacts which rub against the commutator and keep the coil connected to battery, usually made of carbon

-   The max. turning effect is when the coil is horizontal.

-   There is no force when the coil is vertical, but it always overshoots this position

| Turning effect increased by: | Reversing rotation can be done by: |
| --- | --- |
| Increasing the current | Reversing the battery |
| Using a stronger magnet - increasing the strength of the magnetic field | Reversing the poles |
| Increasing the number of turns on the coil. |
