# Properties of Waves, Including Light and Sound

General Wave Properties
-----------------------

-   Waves transfer energy without transferring matter.

-   Examples of wave motion include:

    -   Water Waves

    -   Ropes

    -   Springs

-   Frequency: the number of waves passing any point per second measured in hertz (Hz)

-   Period: time taken for one oscillation in seconds

-   Wavefront: the peak of a transverse wave or the compression of a longitudinal wave

-   Speed: how fast the wave travels measured in m/s

-   Wavelength: distance between a point on one wave to the corresponding point on the next wave in length

-   Amplitude: maximum displacement of a wave from its undisturbed point.

-   Transverse Waves

-   Travelling waves in which oscillation is perpendicular to direction of travel

-   Has crests and troughs

-   For example, light, water waves and vibrating string

-   Longitudinal Waves

    -   Travelling waves in which oscillation is parallel to direction of travel.

    -   Has compressions and rarefactions

    -   For example, sound waves

-   Refraction:

    -   Speed and wave length is reduced but frequency stays the same and the wave changes direction

    -   Mechanical waves slow down when they pass from a denser to a rarer material and vice versa

    -   Note: Electromagnetic waves like light increase in speed from an optically denser to a rarer medium.

    -   When wave is slowed down, it is refracted towards normal

    -   When wave is sped up, it is refracted away from normal

    -   Deep water is denser than shallow water

    -   Deep water to shallow water: speed decreases, wavelength decreases, and frequency remains constant

-   Shallow water to deep water: speed increases wavelength increases, and frequency remains constant

-   Reflection:

    -   Waves bounce away from surface at same angle they strike it

    -   Angle of incidence = angle of reflection

    -   The incident ray, normal and reflected ray all lie on the same plane.

    -   Speed, wavelength and frequency are unchanged by reflection

-   Diffraction:

-   Waves bend round the sides of an obstacle or spread out as they pass through a gap.

-   Wider gaps produce less diffraction.

-   When the gap size is equal to the wavelength, maximum diffraction occurs

Reflection of Light
-------------------

-   Plane (flat) mirrors produce a reflection.

-   Rays from an object reflect off the mirror into our eyes, but we see them behind the mirror.

-   The image has these properties:

    -   Image is the same size as the object

    -   Image is the same distance from the mirror as object

    -   A line joining corresponding points of the image and object meet the mirror at a right angle

    -   Image is virtual: no rays actually pass through the image and the image cannot be formed on a screen

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image025.png)

-   Laws of reflection:

    -   Angle of incidence = angle of reflection

    -   The incident ray reflected ray and normal are always on the same plane (side of mirror)

-   Critical angle: angle at which refracted ray is parallel to the surface of material.

-   If the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle there is no refracted ray, there is total internal reflection.

-   If the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle the incidence ray will split into a refracted ray and a weaker reflected ray.

Refraction of Light
-------------------

-   Refraction is the bending when light travels from one medium to another due to the change in speed of the ray of light.

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image027.png)

-   Note:

    -   The emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray only if the sides of the glass are parallel.

    -   i = angle of incidence, r = angle of refraction

-   Light put in at one end is totally internally reflected until it comes out the other end.

-   Application: Optical Fibres

    -   Used in communications: signals are coded and sent along the fiber as pulses of laser light

    -   Used in medicine: an endoscope, an instrument used by surgeons to look inside the body; contains a long bundle of optic fibers.

Thin Converging Lens
--------------------

-   Principal focus: the point where rays parallel to the principal axis converge with a converging lens.

-   Focal length: distance from principle focus and the optical center.

-   Principal axis: line that goes through optical center, and the 2 foci.

-   Optical center: the center of the lens

-   Real: image can be caught on a screen

-   Virtual: image cannot be caught on a screen

Real Image

-   When object is further away from the optical centre than F' is

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image028.png)

A) A ray through centre of the lens passes straight through the lens.

B) A ray parallel to the principal axis passes through the focus on the other side of the lens

C) A ray through F' will leave the lens parallel to the principal axis

Virtual Image

-   When the object is closer to the optical centre than F' is

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image029.png)

-   Magnifying glass: when a convex lens is used like this - an object is closer to a convex (converging) lens than the principal focus (like the diagram above), the rays never converge. Instead, they appear to come from a position behind the lens. The image is upright and magnified, it is a virtual image.

-   Images can be:

    -   Enlarged: The image is larger than the object.

    -   Same size: The image is the same size as the object.

    -   Diminished: The image is smaller than the object.

    -   Upright: The image is in the same vertical orientation as the object.

Dispersion of Light
-------------------

Refraction by a prism:

-   When light is refracted by a prism, the incidence ray is not parallel to the emergent ray, since the prism's sides are not parallel.

-   If a beam of white light is passed through a prism it is dispersed into a spectrum.

-   White light is a mixture of colors, and the prism refracts each color by a different amount -- red is deviated least & violet most

-   Monochromatic light is that of a single frequency and colour.

-   The visible spectrum of light is acronymed as ROYGBIV

Electromagnetic Spectrum
------------------------

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image031.png)

-   ROMAN MEN INVENTED VERY UNUSUAL XRAY GUNS

-   All electromagnetic waves:

    -   Travel at the speed of light: approximately 3 × 108m/s.

    -   They travel at around the same speed in air too.

    -   Don't need a medium to travel through (travel through a vacuum)

    -   Can transfer energy

    -   Are produced by particles oscillating or losing energy in some way

    -   Are transverse waves

-   Applications:

    -   Radio waves: radio and television communications

    -   Microwaves: satellite television and telephones

    -   Safety issue: cause internal heating of body tissues

    -   Infrared: electrical appliances (radiant heaters and grills), remote controllers for televisions and intruder alarms

    -   X-rays: medicine (x-ray photography and killing cancer cells) and security

    -   Safety issue: is a mutagen, it cause cancer (mutations)

    -   Monochromatic: light of a single wavelength and color (used in lasers)

Sound
-----

-   Sound is a mechanical wave.

-   Sound waves come from a vibrating source e.g. loudspeaker

-   As the loudspeaker cone vibrates, it moves forwards and backwards, which squashes & stretches the air in front.

-   As a result, a series of compressions (squashes) and rarefactions (stretches) travel out through the air, these are sound waves

-   Humans can hear frequencies between 20 and 20 000Hz.

-   Properties:

    -   Sound waves are longitudinal: they have compressions and rarefactions and oscillate backwards and forwards.

    -   Sound waves need a medium to travel through as it moves due to oscillating particles.

-   Ultrasound Waves: high frequency sound waves, medically used to look at structures and organs inside the human body, i.e. to form an image of a fetus in a pregnancy

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image032.png)

-   Compression: High pressure section of a longitudinal wave

-   Rarefaction: Low pressure section of a longitudinal wave

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image033.png)

-   The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.

-   The higher the amplitude, the louder the sound

-   If a sound is repeated 0.1 seconds or more after it is first heard, the brain senses it again.

-   Therefore, given the adequate distance, if sound reflects off a surface, and comes back, an echo is produced.

| Speed of sound in varrious media |
| --- |
| Medium | State | Speed |
| Concrete | Solid | 5000 m/s |
| Pure Water | Liquid | 1400 m/s |
| Air | Gas | 330 m/s |
| **V** in Gas **V** in Liquid **V** in solid |

Finding the speed of sound

-   When sound reflects off of a wall, it will come back to you; echo

-   If you know the distance between you and the wall, and measure how long it takes for the echo to sound, you can figure out the speed of sound in air.

-   Remember to take into account that sound has gone there & back
