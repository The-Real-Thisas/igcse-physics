# Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor

-   If a current carrying conductor is in a magnetic field, it warps the field lines.

-   The field lines from the magnet want to straighten out naturally.

-   This causes a catapult like action on the wire creating a force

-   If you reverse current, you will reverse direction of force

-   If you reverse direction of field, you will reverse direction of force.

-   The direction of the force, current or magnetic field is given byÂ Fleming's left-hand rule:
