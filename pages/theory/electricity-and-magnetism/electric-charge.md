# Electric Charge

-   There are 2 types of charges: positive and negative.

-   Unlike charges attract and like charges repel.

-   The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C).

-   The presence of an electrostatic charge can be detected using a leaf electroscope.

    -   If a charged object is placed near the cap, charges are induced.

    -   The metal cap gets one type of charge (positive or negative) and the metal stem and gold leaf get the other type of charge so they repel each other.

-   Electric field: region in which electric charge experiences a force.

-   The direction of an electric field at a point is the direction of the force on a positive charge at that point

-   Conductors: materials that let electrons pass through them. Metals are the best electrical conductors as they have free electrons. E.g. copper

-   Insulators: materials that hardly conduct at all. Their electrons are tightly held to atoms and hardly move, but they can be transferred by rubbing. E.g. Rubber

-   Induced charges:

    -   Charging a body involves the addition or removal of electrons.

    -   A charge that "appears" on an uncharged object because of a charged object nearby

    -   For example if a positively charged rod is brought near a small piece of aluminum foil, electrons in foil are pulled towards rod, which leaves the bottom of the foil with a net positive charge.

    -   The attraction is stronger than repulsion because the attracting charges are closer than the repelling ones.


 Current
-------

-   Current: a flow of charge, the SI unit is the Ampere (A).

-   An ammeter measures the current in a circuit and is connected in series

-   Current is a rate of flow of charge.

-   In metals, current is caused by a flow of electrons

-   Current follows path of least resistance

-   Conventional current flows in the direction opposite to that which electrons flow in.

-   Red = Conventional Current

-   Green = flow of electrons
