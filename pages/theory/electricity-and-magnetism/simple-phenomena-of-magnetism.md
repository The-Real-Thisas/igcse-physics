# Simple phenomena of magnetism

### MAGNETS:

-   Magnets have a magnetic field around them

-   They 2 opposite poles (North and South) which exert forces on other magnets. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is caused by the interaction of magnetic fields.

    -   Therefore, if magnets are facing each other with opposite poles, they will come together given a small space between them
-   They attract magnetic materials by inducing (permanent or temporary) magnetism in them.

-   Will exert little or no force on a non-magnetic material

-   The direction of an electric field at a point is the direction of the force on a positive charge at that point

-   Induced Magnetism:

    -   Magnets attract materials by inducing magnetism in them; the material becomes a magnet as well.

    -   The side of the material facing the magnet will become the opposite pole as the magnet.

-   Methods of inducing magnetism:

-   A piece of steel becomes permanently magnetized when placed near a magnet, but its magnetism is usually weak.

-   It can be magnetized more strongly by stroking it with one end of a magnet

-   *Most effective method: place it in a solenoid and pass a large, direct current (d.c.) through the coil.*

-   Methods of demagnetisation:

    -   If a magnet is hammered, its atomic magnets are thrown out of line and it becomes demagnetized.

    -   Heating a magnet to a high temperature also demagnetize it.

    -   Stroking with another magnet to destroy the alignment of poles

    -   Place magnet with poles opposite to that which is induced by a d.c. current and insert into coil with d.c. current

    -   Most efficient method: place magnet inside a solenoid connected to an alternating current (a.c.) supply.

-   Soft Iron vs. Steel

| Soft iron | Steel |
| --- | --- |
| Gets magnetized faster but loses its magnetism as soon as inducing magnet is removed. | Slow to be magnetized but retains acquired magnetism for a long time. |
| High susceptibility but low retentivity | Low susceptibility but high retentivity. |
| Use: core in the transformer | Use: making magnets. |

Permanent Magnet vs. Electromagnet

| Permanent Magnet | Electromagnet |
| --- | --- |
| Design: hard magnetic material | Design: Uses a solenoid to create magnetic field |
| Use: for applications where magnetism is needed over long periods -- fridge doors | Use: For applications where magnetic field needs to be turned on & off - scrap metal moving |
