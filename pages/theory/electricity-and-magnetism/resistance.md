# Resistance

Factors affecting resistance:

-   Length

    -   The electrons have to travel a longer length and thus encounter more resistance.

-   Cross-sectional area

    -   More electrons can flow per unit time, increasing the current and therefore decreasing the resistance.

-   Material

    -   Better conductor = less resistance

-   Ohm's law states that voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it. This is only true if the temperature of the resistor or lamp remains constant
