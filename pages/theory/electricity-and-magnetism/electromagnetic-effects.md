# Electromagnetic Effects

-   Electromagnetic Induction: If a wire is passed across a magnetic field/changing magnetic field, a small EMF is induced and can be detected by a galvanometer.

-   The direction of an induced EMF opposes the change causing it.

-   The induced EMF can be increased by:

    -   moving the wire faster

    -   using a stronger magnet

    -   Increasing length of wire in magnetic field, e.g. looping the wire through the field several times.

-   The current and EMF direction can be reversed by:

    -   moving the wire in the opposite direction

    -   turning the magnet round so that the field direction is reversed

-   Fleming's right-hand rule gives the current direction:

-   The induced EMF (and current) can be increased by:

    -   moving the magnet faster

    -   using a stronger magnet

    -   increasing the number of turns in the coil

-   If the magnet is pulled away, the direction of the induced EMF (and current) is reversed

-   Using South pole instead of North pole reverses direction of induced EMF (and current)

-   If the magnet is held still, there is no EMF

-   An induced current always flows in a direction such that it opposes the change which produced it.

-   When a magnet is moved towards a coil the pole of the coil and magnet next to each other are the same.

-   When the magnet is moved away the poles are opposite (opposite poles attract).

-   The pole-type (north or south) is controlled by the direction in which the current is induced.

-   The direction of the current is given by the right-hand grip rule:

-   The fingers point in the conventional current direction and the thumb gives the North Pole.
