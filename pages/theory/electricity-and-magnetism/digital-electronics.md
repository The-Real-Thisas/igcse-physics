# Digital Electronics

-   Analogue uses a whole range of continuous variations to transmit a signal that include variations of high and low states.

-   Digital signals use only 2 states, on and off.

-   Logic gates are processors that are circuits containing transistors and other components. Their function is shown by the truth table below (3 columns from the right)
