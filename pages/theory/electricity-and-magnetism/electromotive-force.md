# Electromotive Force (EMF)

-   The energy supplied by the source in driving a unit charge around a circuit.

-   The maximum voltage a cell can produce is called the electromotive force (EMF), measured in volts.

-   When a current is being supplied, the voltage is lower because of the energy wastage inside the cell.

-   A cell produces its maximum PD when not in a circuit and not supplying current.
