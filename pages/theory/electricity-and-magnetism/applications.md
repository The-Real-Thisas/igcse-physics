# Applications

-   In a direct current (d.c) the electrons flow in a singular direction.

-   In an alternating current (a.c) the direction of flow is reversed in regular time periods.

-   A.C Generator:

    -   The coil is made of insulated copper wire and is rotated by turning the shaft; the slip rings are fixed to the coil and rotate with it.

    -   The brushes are 2 contacts which rub against the slip rings and keep the coil connected to the outside part of the circuit, usually made of carbon.

    -   When the coil is rotated, it cuts magnetic field lines, so an EMF is generated, which makes a current flow.

    -   Each side of the coil travels upwards then downwards then upwards etc. so the current flows backwards then forwards then backwards etc. so it is an alternating current.

-   The current is maximum when the coil is horizontal since field lines are being cut at the fastest rate and 0 when the coil is vertical, since it is cutting NO field lines.

-   The EMF can be increased by:

    -   increasing the number of turns on the coil

    -   increasing the area of the coil

    -   using a stronger magnet

    -   rotating the coil faster
