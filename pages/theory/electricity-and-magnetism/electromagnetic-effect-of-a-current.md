-   Increasing the strength of the field

-   Increasing the current increases the strength of the field

-   Increasing the number of turns of a coil increases the strength increases the strength of the field.

-   Reversing the current direction reverses the magnetic field direction (right-hand rule).

-   The direction of a magnetic field line at a point is the direction of the force on the N pole of a magnet at that point

-   Magnetic effect of current is used in a relay and a circuit breaker.
