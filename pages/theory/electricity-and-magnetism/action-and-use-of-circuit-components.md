# Action and Use of Circuit Components

-   A potential divider divides the voltage into smaller parts.

-   To find the voltage (at V~OUT~) we use the following formula:

-   A variable potential divider (potentiometer) is the same as the one above but using a variable resistor; it acts like a potential divider, but you can change output voltage.

-   Input Transducers:

    -   Thermistor: input sensor and a transducer. It is a temperature-dependent resistor. At higher temperature there is less resistance.

    -   Light dependent resistor (LDR): input sensor and a transducer. When light intensity increases, resistance decreases.

-   Relays:

    -   A switch operated by an electromagnet

-   Normally closed relay: when coil *not energized*, switch is closed, completing circuit

-   Normally open relay: when coil *energized*, switch is closed, completing circuit

-   Diodes:

    -   A device that has an extremely high resistance in one direction and a low resistance in the other, therefore it effectively only allows current to flow in one direction

    -   Forward bias is when the diode is pointing in the direction of the conventional current and reverse bias is the opposite

    -   It can be used in a rectifier; turns AC current into DC current.
