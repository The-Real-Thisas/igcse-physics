# D.C. Motor

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/physics-0625/image061.png)

-   When a current-carrying coil is in a magnetic field, it experiences a turning effect.

-   A DC motor runs on a direct current.

-   The coil is made of insulated copper wire and is free to rotate between the poles of the magnet.

-   The commutator (split-ring) is fixed to the coil and rotates with it.

-   When the coil overshoots the vertical, the commutator changes direction of the current through it, so the forces change direction and keep the coil turning.

-   The brushes are two contacts which rub against the commutator and keep the coil connected to battery, usually made of carbon

-   The max. turning effect is when the coil is horizontal.

-   There is no force when the coil is vertical, but it always overshoots this position

| Turning effect increased by: | Reversing rotation can be done by: |
| --- | --- |
| Increasing the current | Reversing the battery |
| Using a stronger magnet - increasing the strength of the magnetic field | Reversing the poles |
| Increasing the number of turns on the coil. |
