# Transformers

-   AC currents can be increased or decreased by using a transformer.

-   Consists of a primary coil, a secondary coil and an iron core.

-   The iron core gets magnetized by the incoming current and this magnetism then creates a current in the leaving wire.

-   The power is the same on both sides (assume= 100% efficiency).

-   You can figure out number of coils and the voltage with:

(Under 100% efficiency)

-   When magnetic field is changed across the primary coil by connecting it with A.C. an e.m.f. induces across the secondary coil.

-   The iron core channels the alternating field through the secondary coil, inducing an alternating e.m.f. across it.

-   A step-up transformer increases the voltage and a step-down transformer decreases it.

-   Transformers used to make high voltage AC currents.

-   Since power lost in a resistor , having a lower current will decrease the power loss.

-   Since transmission cables are many kilometres long they have a lot of resistance, so a transformer is used to increase the voltage and decrease the current to decease power lost.

-   The advantages of high-voltage transmission:

    -   Less power lost

    -   Thinner, light, and cheaper cables can be used since current is reduced
