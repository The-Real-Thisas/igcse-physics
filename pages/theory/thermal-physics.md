| Solid | Liquid | Gas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed shape and volume | Fixed volume but changes shape depending on its container | No fixed shape or volume, gases fill up containers |
| Strong forces of attraction between particles- particles close to each other. | Weaker attractive forces than solids- medium distances between particels | Almost no intermolecular forces- large distances between particles |
| Fixed pattern (lattice) | No fixed pattern, liquids take shape of their container | Particles far apart, and move quickly |
| Atoms vibrate but can't change positionÂ fixed volume and shape | Particles slide past each other.|

-   The more the kinetic energy in a gas, the faster it's particles move and therefore the gas is at a higher temperature.

-   The pressure gases exert on a container is due to the particles colliding on the container walls.

-   The greater the kinetic energy in gasses the faster they move and the more often they collide on the container's walls.

-   Therefore, the volume is constant, then increasing the temperature will increase the pressure.

-   Thus, if there is a change in momentum of the particles, the kinetic energy decreases, decreasing the collisions on the container walls and thus the pressure.

### BROWNIAN MOTION

-   Gas molecules move randomly. This is because of repeated random collisions with other gas molecules, which constantly change the direction they move in.

-   Small molecules move much faster and have higher energy than larger molecules. They can effectively move large molecules due to repeated random bombardment- this can be seen by larger smoke particles moving.

-   Therefore, the random motion of particles in a suspension is evidence for the kinetic molecular model of matter.
