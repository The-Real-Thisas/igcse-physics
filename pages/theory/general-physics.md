# General Physics

Length and Time
---------------

### LENGTH

-   A rule (ruler) is used to measure length for distances between 1mm and 1meter.

-   For even smaller lengths, use a micrometer screw gauge.

-   SI unit for length is the meter (m)

-   To find out volume of regular object, use mathematical formula

-   To find out volume of irregular object, put object into measuring cylinder with water. When object added, it displaces water, making water level rise. Measure this rise. This is the volume.

### TIME

-   Interval of time is measured using clocks or a stopwatch

-   SI unit for time is the second(s)

-   To find the amount of time it takes a pendulum to make a spin, time ~25 circles and then divide by the same number as the number of circles.

Motion
------

-   Speed is the distance an object moves in a time frame. It is measured in meters/second (m/s) or kilometers/hour (km/h).

∴ Speedaverage=Total Distance Total Time∴ Speedaverage=Total Distance Total Time

-   Speed is a scalar quantity as it only shows magnitude.

-   Speed in a specified direction is velocity, which is a vector

-   Area under the line equals to the distance travelled

-   Gradient=y2-y1x2-x1= ΔvtGradient=y2-y1x2-x1=Δvt = Acceleration (m/s)^2^

-   Positive acceleration means the velocity of a body is increasing

-   Deceleration or negative acceleration means the velocity of a body is decreasing

-   A curved speed time graph means changing acceleration.

-   Acceleration is the rate of change in velocity per unit of time, and a vector as it's direction is specified

-   Gradient=y2-y1x2-x1=Δdt=Gradient=y2-y1x2-x1=Δdt= Speed (m/s)

-   Therefore, distance:

    -   With constant speed: Speed × TimeSpeed×Time

    -   With constant acceleration^1^: Final Speed+Initial Speed2×TimeFinalSpeed+InitialSpeed2×Time

### ACCELERATION BY GRAVITY

-   An object in free-fall near to the Earth has a constant acceleration caused by gravity due to the Earth's uniform gravitational field

-   Objects are slowed down by air resistance. When deceleration caused by air resistance = acceleration by gravity, i.e. no net force acting on a body in free fall, the body reached terminal velocity

Mass and Weight
---------------

-   Mass: A measure of matter in a body and the body's resistance to motion.

-   Weight is the force of gravity on a body as a result of its mass.

Weight=Mass×GravityWeight=Mass×Gravity

-   Weights (and hence masses) may be compared using a balance
